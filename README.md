## Bulletin Board
- Glitch Link:  https://creative-exercise-tacheampong.glitch.me/
- Topic: Canvas
- Bulletin Board Inspiration: https://rohitlakhotia.com/blog/html-css-projects-for-beginners/ (1. Sticky Notes)
- I created this code based on example code for shapes in the W3School examples and created my idea from an inspiration
from a sticky notes example for html and css projects. I created my own rendition of thumbtacks and created a triangle
sticky note. There is also a sign for the name of my application on top of the bulletin board
